# Spensieur Finance by Noxasch

Astute Finance is a Personal Expense tracker with analytics that store data locally. <br>
Future version might have restricted feature but all released feature will never be restricted.

It is a desktop first application as I strongly believe doing heavy analysis should be done on a pc or laptop. <br>
Mobile version will follow but only with limited capabilites as it more suit for quick glance and easy data input.
