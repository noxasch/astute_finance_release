# Astute Finance by Noxasch

Astute Finance is a Personal Expense tracker with analytics that store data locally. <br>
Future version might have restricted feature but all released feature will never be restricted.

It is a desktop first application as I strongly believe doing heavy analysis should be done on a pc or laptop. <br>
Mobile version will follow but only with limited capabilites as it more suit for quick glance and easy data input.

Current platform support:
- [x] MacOS
- [x] Windows
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] Android
- [ ] iOS

Public facing repo for astute finance app desktop app
