## Repo moved
https://github.com/noxasch/spensieur_release

Spensieur is a Personal Expense tracker with analytics that store data locally. <br>
This app is release as if and we will not be responsble for any losses.

Future release (might include):
- bug fixes
- budgetting feature

It is a desktop first and offline first application as I strongly believe doing heavy analysis should be done on a pc or laptop. <br>
Mobile version will follow but only with limited capabilites as it more suit for quick glance and easy data input.
